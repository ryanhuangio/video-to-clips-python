# Video to Clips

Convert a video into clips with defined start and end time stamps, and add an outro to each video.

1. Install Moviepy `pip install moviepy`
2. Edit `input_videp_file` and `outro_file` and `clips` array in `process.py`. If you only want to convert the video into clips without appending the outro file, please use `process-clips-only.py`
3. Run `python3 process.py`
